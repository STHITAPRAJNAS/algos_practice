Problem Statement#\
Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S,’
find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’.
Return 0 if no such subarray exists.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S=7
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to ‘7’ is [5, 2].

Example 2:

Input: [1,2, 1, 5, 2, 8], S=7
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to ‘7’ is [8].

Time Complexity#
The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N).
The outer for loop runs for all elements, and the inner while loop processes each element only once; 
therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N)
O(N+N), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N)
.

Space Complexity#
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1)
